# a little tool to join CSVs

Use it like this: `joincsv labels.csv content1.csv content2.csv`

All CSV files must have the same number of columns. Labels from the first CSV are applied as headers
for the corresponding columns of data from the successive CSVs.

If that doesn't make any sense, see the examples folder.
